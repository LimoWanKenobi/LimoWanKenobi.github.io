Hello World! from Github.io.

This is my first post using the [Skinny Bones](https://github.com/mmistakes/skinny-bones-jekyll) theme for Jekyll. And everything looks great so far.

I will try to migrate a few posts from [LimoTonterias](http://limotonterias.blogspot.com/), my previous blog, but most on it is personal stuff and I want this blog to be a little more technical.

We will see how this goes.
