I am a C# and JavaScript developer and after listeing the news  about ...*******  I am very excited about Microsoft open sourcing .Net and ASP .Net. But I didn't have a chance to do anything after the announcement because I was preparing for three weeks of holidays visiting family and friends in Mexico.

After two weeks of vacations, I found myself willing to open my laptop and do something. 

I saw the following tweet from Richard Dalton and I decided that I also wanted to test it.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="es"><p>If you&#39;re thinking of tinkering with .Net on your Mac, this post by <a href="https://twitter.com/JeremyCMorgan">@JeremyCMorgan</a> worked for me.&#10;<a href="https://t.co/tgGy0rE0Hj">https://t.co/tgGy0rE0Hj</a></p>&mdash; Richard Dalton (@richardadalton) <a href="https://twitter.com/richardadalton/status/549378599791644673">diciembre 29, 2014</a></blockquote>

Following the instructions linked in the tweet it was really easy to start a KVM server on my MacBook and run the sample applications.
I got into issues with the Kestrel process hanging and having to kill everything because I tried to stop it using Ctrl-C instead of just pressing Enter but everything else was nice and tidy.
