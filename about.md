I'm a fugitive of three Math University Faculties now making a life as a Professional Software Janitor, Sr. Procrastinator and Jr. Father.

I have been a professional Software Janitor since 2008 cleaning mostly web applications using C# and JavaScript.

I love to solve problems and I like to participate in all kind of programming contests.

Currently I'm working as a Software Developer Engineer in AWS as part of the L7 Load Balancing team.
