I'm a fugitive of three Math University Faculties now trying to make a life as a .Net developer. My biggest interests are Image Processing, Artificial Life and Intelligence, Genetic algorithms, Neural Networks, Ajax and JQuery.  
Currently I'm working as a Software Developer for the United Nations Office in Vienna.
